It uses ExtJs javascript library (http://extjs.com/) - please download, and
correct links to extjs resources in index.php
It is not finished,.... simply wanted a way to show what is a progress and
watch code development.
I need to try and customize chats. But I feel a need to construct for testing
some typical environment like user accounts/profiles, login/logout/signon
facilities, and some imitation of game sessions, to be able to check, if
channels and rooms are set up correctly. So I spend efforts to construct that
toy, and to have some fun and be knowledgable of ExtJs, which I like, I use
that very worthy javascript framework.
